# Multimodal Pipeline for Atherosclerosis Risk
Written report of an end-to-end multimodal pipeline integrating statistical and neural models for atherosclerosis risk stratification from CT (calcium scoring), ultrasound (IMT, stenosis), PPG (arterial stiffness), and clinical risk factors. 

Core methods: uncertainty quantification, explainable AI, datapreprocessing, model inference, decision-level fusion, and adaptive deployment.
